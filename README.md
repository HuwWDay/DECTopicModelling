# DECTopicModelling
Side project doing various types of topic modelling on content from the Data Ethics Club website

The plan:
1. Find a way to load in all the DEC writeups from the website (or the github?) as data
2. Index them with their dates and other metadata
3. Use BERTopic for topic modelling, want to write some code for fine tuning parameters for UMAP and HDBSCAN
4. Want to do some dynamic topic modelling and maybe hierarchical as well?
5. Find some cute ways to visualise how the different topics have varied over time
